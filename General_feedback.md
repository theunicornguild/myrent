 1. mention that they need to install the requirements during the setup
 * lots of missing full stops
 * mention that they need to migrate after changing the model
 * we never included the transactions urls
 * the plivo issue -> needs a work email
 * wasn't able to try any of the pages until the whole project was done. maybe you can comment out the urls in the navbar and after you create each one you tell them to remove the comment
