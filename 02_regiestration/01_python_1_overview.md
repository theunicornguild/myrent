### Overview

In this chapter we will be covering the registration and logging in functionality in this application, we will be using the django authenticaion application that is given to you by default using django, we will change the templates on every view and then we will create our own signup view too 

Templates will be shared with you whenever we create a new view to make things easier for you to focus mostly on the backend development instead of styling(html/css)
