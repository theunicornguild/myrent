### Reviewing

Let's try and go to each of these newly created urls, and test to see if they do what they are supposed to do.

It may be difficult to check if payments do actually go through but if you are able to generate unique urls and it redirects you to tap then you should be fine for now 

Also try and make some fake transactions in the admin page and view them in the views that you just created to see if everything works perfectly 

You may move the following cards from the `Doing` list in your `Trello` board to the `Done` list

   - Pay functionality
   - Generate Unique url to send as an SMS for payments
   - As a user I can see a list of transactions made by a renter
   - As a user I can check renters who did not pay
   - As a user I can view newest successful transactions
