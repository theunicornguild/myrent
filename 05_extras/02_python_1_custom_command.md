### Creating a custom command

And now we will create a custom manage.py function! This function will be run automatically at the start of every month and to do that letâ€™s go to the main folder and then create another folder inside of it and call it `management` and inside the management folder create another folder and name it `commands`, then inside the commands folder create a file and name it `smser.py`

The final path should look like this `main/management/commands/smser.py`

Type the following inside that newly created file

```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError
from main.models import Renter

class Command(BaseCommand):
   help = 'Sends SMS messages to all Renters'

   def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
       renters = Renter.objects.all()
       for renter in renters:
           renter.sms()
       self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS('Successfully sent SMS to : %s renters') % len(renters))
```

This function when you start it using `python manage.py smser` will grab all the renter objects and for each one of them it will start the .sms() method on them to automate sending SMS messages
