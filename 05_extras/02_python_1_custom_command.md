### Trello

With this done we can go to our `Trello` board and move the card `Create a custom django command to send renters their sms` to the `Doing` list

### Creating a custom command

And now we will create a custom manage.py function! This function will be run automatically at the start of every month. To do that letâ€™s go to the main folder and then create another folder inside of it and call it `management` and inside the `management` folder create another folder and name it `commands`. Then, inside the commands folder create a file and name it `smser.py`.

The final path should look like this `main/management/commands/smser.py`

Type the following inside that newly created file

```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError
from main.models import Renter

class Command(BaseCommand):
   help = 'Sends SMS messages to all Renters'

   def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
       renters = Renter.objects.all()
       for renter in renters:
           renter.sms()
       self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS('Successfully sent SMS to : %s renters') % len(renters))
```

When you start it using `python manage.py smser`, this function will grab all the renter objects and for each one of them it will call the `.sms()` method on them to automate sending the SMS messeges.

### Trello & Git Workflow

With this done we can go to our `Trello` board and move the card `Create a custom django command to send renters their sms` to the `Review` list

Open the terminal in this current project and type the following

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Django custom command"
```
