### Reviewing

Let's try and go to each of these newly created urls, and test to see if they do what they are supposed to do.

If you are able to create new renters / view them / view a specific one / delete one / edit one 

You may move the following cards from the `Doing` list in your `Trello` board to the `Done` list

   - As a user I can add renters
   - As a user I can view my renter list
   - As a user I can view a specific renter
   - As a user I can delete a renter
   - As a user I can edit a renter
